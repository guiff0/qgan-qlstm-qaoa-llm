run_pipeline.py -- single entry point for the whole QGAN-LLM pipeline
================================================================================
GOAL
    Run every stage of the project -- environment check, data acquisition,
    data preparation, training + evaluation of every model, and the Chapter 4
    comparison -- with ONE command, instead of running six separate scripts
    by hand in the right order (see RUNNING.md for what this replaces).

OBJECTIVE
    Make a multi-hour, multi-stage pipeline SAFE TO INTERRUPT AND RESUME.
    Every stage that finishes is recorded in a small state file; if the
    process is killed (crash, Ctrl-C, disconnected SSH session, out-of-
    memory kill) and you run this again, it picks up after the last stage
    that actually completed, rather than re-running -- and re-paying for --
    everything from the start.

ASSUMPTIONS
    - You have already followed SETUP.md (dependencies installed, raw data
      files or API credentials in place) at least up to the point where
      `python -m scripts.verify_environment` can meaningfully run.
    - config/default_config.yaml reflects the run you want (model
      hyperparameters, ablations, date ranges). This script does not
      change your config; it only decides WHICH scripts to invoke and
      WHETHER to skip ones already done.
    - Each stage below is itself idempotent and safe to re-run (this was
      true of every script this orchestrates before this file existed);
      this script adds resumability on top, it does not change what any
      individual stage does.
    - Running as `python run_pipeline.py` from the repository root (same
      assumption every other script here already makes).

EXECUTION STEPS (in order; see STEPS below for the authoritative list)
    1. verify_environment  -- python -m scripts.verify_environment
    2. acquire_dukascopy   -- python -m scripts.acquire_all_data --steps dukascopy
    3. acquire_xval        -- python -m scripts.acquire_all_data --steps xval
    4. acquire_fred        -- python -m scripts.acquire_all_data --steps fred
    5. prepare_data        -- python -m scripts.prepare_data
    6. train_eval:<model>  -- python -m src.experiments.run_all --only "<model>"
                              (one invocation per model/ablation in your
                              config, so a single model's crash doesn't
                              lose progress on the others)
    7. verify_chapter4     -- python -m scripts.verify_chapter4

WHY SUBPROCESSES, NOT DIRECT FUNCTION CALLS
    Each stage is invoked as a separate `python -m ...` subprocess, exactly
    as documented in RUNNING.md, rather than importing and calling each
    script's main() in-process. Two reasons: (1) memory from a finished
    stage (a multi-GB pandas DataFrame in prepare_data, a trained model's
    CUDA/CPU tensors) is fully released by the OS when that subprocess
    exits, instead of accumulating across a many-hour single process; (2)
    each stage's own progress bars, prints, and logs pass straight through
    unmodified -- this file adds resumability without duplicating or
    reimplementing any stage's own logic.

THE "ASK ONCE" RULE (see the docstring on `decide_skip_policy` below)
    This script prompts at most ONCE per invocation, at the very start, and
    only if there is something it COULD skip. That single answer ("skip
    everything the state file says is done" / "ignore the state file and
    redo everything") is then applied uniformly to every stage for the rest
    of this run -- it does not ask again stage by stage.

CENTRAL MONITORING (see `render_dashboard` / `watch_pipeline` below)
    This same file is also the monitoring surface for the whole run, not
    just the launcher: while a --jobs>1 parallel batch is in flight, it
    automatically redraws a status table for every step in that batch
    (status, elapsed time, and the latest progress line from that step's
    own log) every few seconds -- so you never need to go hunting through
    logs/pipeline/*.log by hand just to see whether things are still
    moving. The exact same table is available on demand, from a second
    terminal or SSH session, via `python run_pipeline.py --watch`, which
    reads the same state file and log files the running pipeline is
    already writing and never starts or affects anything itself.

Run:
    python run_pipeline.py                  # interactive (asks once, if relevant)
    python run_pipeline.py --yes            # non-interactive: auto-skip completed stages
    python run_pipeline.py --no-skip        # non-interactive: redo everything, ignore state
    python run_pipeline.py --reset          # wipe the state file first, then run everything
    python run_pipeline.py --only "Classical LSTM,QGAN-LLM"   # subset of models for step 6
    python run_pipeline.py --status         # print the state file and exit; runs nothing
    python run_pipeline.py --jobs 3         # run the acquire group, then the train_eval group,
                                             # up to 3 steps at a time within each (see --help)
    python run_pipeline.py --watch          # from another terminal: live status of a running pipeline

    returns {step_id: success}. Used for the two independent groups this
    pipeline has -- acquire_* and train_eval:* (see build_steps) -- never
    across a barrier like prepare_data, which always runs alone.

    Each subprocess writes to its own logs/pipeline/<step_id>.log instead
    of the shared terminal (see run_step's log_to_file docstring), which
    would otherwise hide progress entirely once jobs>1. To make this
    launch command double as central monitoring rather than going dark

    `dashboard_interval` seconds until the whole batch finishes -- so you
    see every task's status and live progress hint without needing a
    second terminal, `tail -f`, or the --watch flag at all; those remain
    available for attaching from elsewhere (e.g. a different SSH session).

    The shared `state` dict is mutated from multiple threads here: plain
    dict item assignment is atomic under the GIL, and save_state()'s write
    is itself atomic (temp file + os.replace, src/utils/io.py), so
    concurrent mark_*() calls are safe without an additional lock -- each
    write reflects the full, current state at that moment, just possibly
    superseded moments later by another thread's equally-valid write.
