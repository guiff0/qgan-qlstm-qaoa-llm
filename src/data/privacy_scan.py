"""
Regex-based PII scan over a DataFrame's text columns -- a real,
reusable capability that was entirely absent from this codebase despite
the manuscript's ethics/data-handling sections describing privacy
safeguards. Ported from an external repository audit (this specific
file was one of the genuinely real ones found there, unlike most of
that repository's metrics layer).

SCOPE: this is a basic regex sweep for common identifiable-information
patterns (email, IPv4, US SSN format, phone numbers). It is a coarse
screening tool, not a certified PII-detection system -- false negatives
are expected for anything not matching these specific patterns (e.g.
non-US ID numbers, names, addresses), and the manuscript should
describe it as a supplementary check on this study's own generated/
cached text (LLM outputs, logs), not a guarantee that no identifiable
information exists anywhere in the pipeline.
