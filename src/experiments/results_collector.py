Results collector.

*** MAJOR PROBLEM REMOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL CODE ***

The original ResultsCollector had this:

    self.expected = {
        'Classical LSTM': {'rmse': 0.523, 'asr': 31.0},
        'QGAN-LLM (20-qubit)': {'rmse': 0.364, 'asr': 8.7},
        ...
    }
    def verify_consistency(self):
        for _, row in self.df.iterrows():
            expected_rmse = self.expected[model_type]['rmse']
            if abs(row['rmse'] - expected_rmse) > 0.001:
                logger.warning(f"discrepancy...")

This "verifies" real results against the exact disputed numbers from
the dissertation, typed in as ground truth. Any run — even one with a
completely untrained, random-weight model — would either match those
numbers by writing them in, or get flagged as "wrong" for NOT matching
disputed figures that were never independently confirmed in the first
place. That's circular: it can only ever confirm what it was told to
expect.

This version does the opposite: it aggregates whatever the actual runs
produced, with NO hardcoded target values anywhere. Discrepancy-checking
against the dissertation's specific numbers is handled separately and
explicitly in scripts/verify_chapter4.py, where you paste in the
dissertation's claims yourself and the two are diffed transparently —
so the comparison is auditable rather than baked into a class attribute.
