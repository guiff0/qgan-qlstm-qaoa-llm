Pathway-specific wiring for mediation.mediation_analysis(), covering the
three pathways with resolved operational definitions:

  M2 -> DV2 (decomposes H2): Qubit Entanglement Level mediates Model Configuration's
                    effect on Attack Success Rate category.
  M3 -> DV3 (decomposes H3): Quantum Noise Injection level mediates Model Configuration's
                    effect on False Positive Rate.
  M4 -> DV4 (decomposes H4): Computational Overhead mediates Model Configuration's
                    effect on Inference Latency.

M1->DV1 and M5->DV5 are deliberately NOT wired here -- per the operational
definitions still pending confirmation (Encoding Fidelity Index and
Quantum State Feature Index), building those now would mean guessing at
constructs the methodology chapter needs to define first.

UNIT-OF-ANALYSIS CAVEAT (applies to all three pathways below, not just
one of them): IV (model configuration: classical vs. quantum) is fixed
for every sample within a single trained model's evaluation -- it does
not vary sample-to-sample the way M and DV can. For a mediation model to
be meaningful, "observations" should be INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTAL RUNS
(e.g. k different training seeds per configuration), not individual
test-set rows from one run, since IV has zero within-run variance to
mediate. Concretely: getting a real n=200 for one of these pathways
means training ~100 classical-configuration models and ~100
quantum-configuration models (varying seed and, for M2, entangling
topology) and computing one (M, DV) pair per run -- not evaluating one
trained model on 200 test-set rows. This is a real, substantial compute
requirement the paper's methodology chapter should state explicitly, not
something these wiring functions can paper over: they accept whatever
arrays they're given and cannot tell the difference between "200
independent runs" and "200 rows from one run" (the latter would run
without error but silently violate mediation's independence assumptions).
