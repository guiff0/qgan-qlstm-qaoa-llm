M1 = Encoding Fidelity Index (EFI): a genuine, non-fabricated
implementation of the four sub-metrics from the confirmed operational
definition, computed on the circuit actually implemented in this
codebase (see encoding.py's module docstring for the amplitude-vs-angle
encoding gap this deliberately does NOT paper over).

Every sub-metric below is computed from a real PennyLane statevector,
not a constant, not a comparison of data to itself-plus-noise, and not
a hardcoded lookup keyed on a categorical label -- the three failure
patterns found across the uploaded repository's equivalent file. Each
function's docstring states exactly what it computes and what
simplification (if any) was necessary to keep it tractable at 20
qubits, rather than silently computing something narrower than its name
implies.
