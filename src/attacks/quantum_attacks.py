"""
Quantum-circuit-targeted attacks: Quantum Noise Injection (-> QSFR) and
Entanglement Disruption (-> EER), from the paper's "Quantum-Specific
Attack Vectors" table (Table 6 companion).

THESE ARE A DIFFERENT THREAT MODEL FROM src/attacks/adversarial.py.
FGSM/PGD/CW there perturb the CLASSICAL features fed into the pipeline
-- the standard adversarial-ML setup behind H2/H4's ASR. The two
attacks here instead perturb the QUANTUM CIRCUIT itself (its trained
rotation parameters, or the structure right after its entangling
gates), modeling an attacker with a fundamentally different capability
-- e.g. a compromised quantum-cloud backend silently drifting gate
calibration, not an attacker manipulating market-data inputs. Report
these as a distinct attack surface in the paper, not as "the quantum
version of the same attack."

Both attacks reuse src/quantum/tomography.py's partial-trace/von
Neumann machinery rather than reimplementing it -- see that file for
why those specific calculations are correct.
