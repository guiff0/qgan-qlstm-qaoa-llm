Resilience metrics: QAR, CQRS, NLCS, and CTR -- the remaining four of
Table 6's six metrics not already covered by quantum_attacks.py (QSFR,
EER) and gradient_obfuscation.py (QGOM).

TWO REAL PROBLEMS IN THE SOURCE DESIGN, FIXED HERE RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER:

1. CTR (Coherence Time Retention) requires a genuine density-matrix
   time-evolution under a decoherence channel -- T2 has no meaning for
   a pure-state, noiseless simulator. A density matrix at n qubits is
   4^n entries, not 2^n: at this study's primary 20-qubit configuration,
   that is 4^20 ~= 1.1 TRILLION entries -- not slow, not expensive,
   ACTUALLY INTACTABLE to hold in memory as a dense array (roughly 17.6
   TB at complex128). This was already flagged in chat and is not solved
   by better code; it is a hardware/scale constraint. ctr() below
   enforces this with a hard, explicit check rather than letting a
   20-qubit call silently hang or OOM: it raises a clear error naming
   the actual memory requirement, and only executes for qubit counts
   where a dense density matrix is realistically tractable (<=12
   qubits, ~4.3 GB at complex128 -- still large, but a documented,
   explicit ceiling rather than a surprise crash).

2. NLCS (Non-Local Correlation Stability), as specified in the source
   document, sums |rho_ij| over the FULL system's off-diagonal elements
   at Hamming distance >= 2, with a Monte Carlo SAMPLE of index pairs
   proposed as the fix for tractability. That sampling scheme reduces
   the number of index-pair evaluations, but does NOT reduce the size
   of `rho` itself -- indexing rho[i, j] still requires the full (2^20,
   2^20) matrix to already exist in memory, which is the exact same
   4^n wall as CTR. Sampling a matrix you cannot construct doesn't help.
   The fix here is different: NLCS is computed on the REDUCED density
   matrix over a fixed-size subsystem (the same partial-trace subsystem
   size used by EER, quantum_attacks.entanglement_disruption_attack),
   not the full system. This is a genuine rescoping (non-local
   correlations within a tractable subsystem, not an approximation of
   the full-system quantity) and is stated as such -- it is not the same
   claim as "non-local correlation across the entire 20-qubit state."
